#Feature: Customizing search queries in Drufus

#  As a doctor
#  So that I can specify my search query parameters
#  I want to customize my search queries in Drufus

#Background: existing settings
#  Given I am on the home page of "Drufus"

#Scenario: successful user login (happy path)
#  When I fill in "username" with "pubmed.tester"
#  And I fill in "password" with "saasbook_pubmed.tester"
#  And I press "Login"
#  Then I should see "pubmed.tester@gmail.com"

#Scenario: failed user login (sad path)
#  When I fill in "username" with "phony"
#  And I fill in "password" with "aaaa"
#  And I press "Login"
#  Then I should not see "phony@gmail.com"
